## Popup placement

The default placement is `bottom-start`, but you could override it with other positions.

Valid placements are:

- `auto`
- `top`
- `right`
- `bottom`
- `left`

Each placement can have a variation from this list:

- `-start`
- `-end`

Some valid examples are:

- `top-end` (on top of reference, right aligned)
- `right-start` (on right of reference, top aligned)
- `bottom` (on bottom, centered)
- `auto-end` (on the side with more space available, alignment depends by placement)
